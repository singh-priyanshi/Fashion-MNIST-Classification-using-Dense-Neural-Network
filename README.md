# Fashion MNIST Classification using Dense Neural Network

This repository contains an implementation of a Dense Neural Network (DNN) for classifying the Fashion MNIST dataset, a dataset of grayscale images of 10 different categories of clothing items such as shirts, trousers, shoes, etc. The project uses TensorFlow and Keras to build and train the neural network, and this guide will take you through the project's architecture, techniques, and machine learning concepts used.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately classify images of fashion items from the Fashion MNIST dataset into one of ten classes. The dataset consists of 70,000 images, each of size 28x28 pixels, which are categorized into the following classes:

- T-shirt/top
- Trouser
- Pullover
- Dress
- Coat
- Sandal
- Shirt
- Sneaker
- Bag
- Ankle boot

The project uses a Dense Neural Network to perform the classification task.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need Python and several libraries including:

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
```

## Dataset

The [Fashion MNIST dataset](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) is a popular dataset used as a benchmark for image classification models. It contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, with each image being a 28x28 grayscale representation of a clothing item.

The dataset is loaded using TensorFlow's `tf.keras.datasets` module.

## Model Architecture

The model is a Dense Neural Network built using the Keras Sequential API. The architecture is as follows:

1. **Input Layer**: The input shape is defined as `(None, 784)` since the images are flattened to a vector of 784 pixels (28x28).
2. **Hidden Layer**: 
   - **Layer 1**: Dense layer with 128 neurons and ReLU activation function. This layer learns complex features from the input data.
3. **Output Layer**:
   - **Layer 2**: Dense layer with 10 neurons and Softmax activation function. The number of neurons corresponds to the 10 classes in the Fashion MNIST dataset, and the Softmax activation is used for multi-class classification.

The model is compiled with the following configurations:

- **Loss Function**: `SparseCategoricalCrossentropy`, which is appropriate for multi-class classification with integer labels.
- **Optimizer**: `Adam`, which is used for efficient gradient-based optimization.
- **Metrics**: `Accuracy`, to evaluate the performance of the model during training and testing.

### Model Summary

### Model Plot

The model architecture can be visualized using `plot_model()`, which provides a graphical representation of the layers and their connections.

## Training Techniques

The model is trained using the following techniques:

- **Normalization**: The pixel values of the images are normalized to a range between 0 and 1 to speed up the convergence of the model.
- **Batching**: The training data is split into smaller batches, typically of size 32 or 64, to make the training process more efficient and reduce memory usage.
- **Epochs**: The model is trained for a specified number of epochs (e.g., 10), where each epoch represents a complete pass over the entire training dataset.
- **Early Stopping**: (Optional) To avoid overfitting, an early stopping mechanism can be used, which stops training once the model's performance on the validation set stops improving.

## Results

The model achieves an accuracy of approximately XX% on the test set, which indicates its effectiveness in classifying different clothing items from the Fashion MNIST dataset. The training and validation loss/accuracy are plotted to visualize the learning process.

## Usage

To use this model, clone the repository and run the Jupyter notebook:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Fashion_MNIST_Classification_using_Dense_Neural_Network
jupyter notebook Fashion_MNIST_Classification_using_Dense_Neural_Network.ipynb
```

You can train the model on the Fashion MNIST dataset and use it to make predictions on new images.
